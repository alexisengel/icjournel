# IC Journal

Inner Chapter Journal is a Wechat Mini Application I created for the company Inner Chapter during my Summer 2019 internship.

## About Inner Chapter
Inner Chapter is an "Ideas Studio" that is based in Shanghai, China.  They work with large and small companies as ad-hoc consultants on marketing-based projects.

## IC Journal
A lot of Inner Chapter's work centers around consumer research.  The project they posed to me was to create software to help scale-up and expidite their informal consumer data aquisition process.  
For the front-end, I created ICJournal. Here users can submit tasks created by Inner Chapter for compensation.  These tasks correlate with the projects Inner Chapter is working on at the time.  They include submitting pictures, videos, blog posts, and filling out surveys. 
This data is then sent to the Inner Chapter database to then be processed and organized by Inner Chapter (also created by me, this back-end part of the project is described more in depth in the Inner Chapter repository).

## Overview of Mini Program

### Welcome Screen and Surveys
When the user opens the Mini Program, this is the welcome screen displayed while the app loads. The user is then brought to the lists of surveys available. These survey answers determine the tags and segments of the users. These tags and segments help Inner Chapter hone in their target population for their marketing research.

### Tasks and Submissions
After the survey screen, the user is brought to the home page of the app: the task list. Tasks are assigned to users depending on their tags and segments and they involve various submission items like pictures, videos, and blog posts. Users are compensated accordingly depending on the task.

### Other Parts
The app also has a profile that keeps track of the completed tasks and total compensation. There is also a more tab where users can learn more about the app and the company in general.

All of the submitions and user information is uploaded to the Inner Chapter Administration website, which was also created by me. To learn more, click on the link: [Inner Chapter Admin Website](https://github.com/alexisengel/innerchapter).
