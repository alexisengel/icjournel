# IC Journal

Inner Chapter Journal is a Wechat Mini Application I created for the company Inner Chapter during my Summer 2019 internship.

## About Inner Chapter
Inner Chapter is an "Ideas Studio" that is based in Shanghai, China.  They work with large and small companies as ad-hoc consultants on marketing-based projects.

## IC Journal
A lot of Inner Chapter's work centers around consumer research.  The project they posed to me was to create software to help scale-up and expidite their informal consumer data aquisition process.  
For the front-end, I created ICJournal. Here users can submit tasks created by Inner Chapter for compensation.  These tasks correlate with the projects Inner Chapter is working on at the time.  They include submitting pictures, videos, blog posts, and filling out surveys. 
This data is then sent to the Inner Chapter database to then be processed and organized by Inner Chapter (also created by me, this back-end part of the project is described more in depth in the Inner Chapter repository).
